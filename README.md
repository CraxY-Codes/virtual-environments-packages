# virtual-environments-packages
This repository contains the code and scripts that we use to build tool packages used in [virtual-environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments).  
Packages are uploaded and attached to the [GitHub Package Registry](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments-packages/packages).

**Note:** Process of transferring source code to this repo is in progress. We are going to make it open-source in future.
